Website crawling utility
======

Leechi is a robust and sneaky wrapper for urllib2.

It is sneaky because it introduces
random delays between requests
and because it changes its User Agent string.

It is robust because it will automatically retry failed requests.

Additionally, it will handle cookies to make session handling
easier or even automatic.

Leechi development was sponsored by the Forschungsdaten Service Center
of Universit√§t Mannheim, Germany <http://service.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/>.
